        <h3>(4) Canvas and SVG tags</h3>
        <p> <b>Ans : </b> SVG means Scalable Vector Graphics. SVG is used to define graphics for the web. SVG is Vector based. SVG has better scalability so we can
            pritend higher quality resolution. SVG can be modified through script and CSS.<br><br>

            canvas is Raster based. Canvas has poor scalability so we can not printed higher quality resolution. Canvas
            can be modified through script only.
